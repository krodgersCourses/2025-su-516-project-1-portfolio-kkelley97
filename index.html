        <p class="fam-text">My parents grew up not far from each other, and went to the IF High School in Idaho Falls Idaho. 
          After my dad served a mission and my mom went to Ricks College for nursing, they met up again when
        dad had to have knee surgery and mom was his nurse. I was born a year after they married, and five 
      brothers and four sisters came after me. </p>

       <p class="fam-text">I was born a long time ago, in the Burley area. When I was tiny we moved to the Idaho Falls area and have lived in the area ever since.
        I was raised on a ranch/farm west of Idaho Falls. I was one of the last classes to attend the New Sweeden Elementry School. I attended 
        Eagle Rock Jr. High and Skyline High School. My hope to go to college was not ment to be at that time and I went to work at a bank. Other 
        positions I held included, a desk clerk at a hotel, secretary for a couple businesses, data entry clerk, and truck driver. I married and 
        had two children, and ended up getting a divorse. During this time I lost my mother in a car accident.

        <p class="fam-text">As a single mom with a dead beat father, I was accepted into the welding program at the local technical college. After completing the 
        program and earning a Certificate in Welding, I went to work in Shelley Idaho. I met Dale and we were married, combining our families and 
        had two more children (making six). The year Dale and I married, I lost my youngest brother Stephen in a farming accident. I quit welding 
        when I was too pregnant to do the labor and opened a daycare. After five years I closed the daycare and went to work for the local school 
        district. I have worked there for twenty years. Oh, and I still drive truck every chance I get.

        I decided to go to college and go into computer technology. As I worked toward my degree, the desire to teach has become stronger. I will 
        graduate next week and hope to find a teaching position this year through the CTE program. One of my favorite things is to create websites. 
        However, it is easier to design for someone else. During this time our family has grown; five inlaws, fifteen grandchildren, and two great 
        grandchildren have graced our lives.
