            The first school I attended was the same elementry school my dad attended. While in elementry the Jr. High, I would have attended
            burned down. I went to the new Jr. high and then on to high school. Here are the schools I atteneded.
        </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>New Sweeden Elementry School</li>
        <li>Eagle Rock Jr. High</li>
        <li>Skyline High School</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After high school, life went on until I was 30 and then I went back to school to learn how to weld to support my 2 boys. 
        Years later through the technology of the internet, I was able to go back to college and get a degree.
